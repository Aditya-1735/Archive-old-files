# Shell -> shell acts as a bridge between the user and the operating system
# A shell is a program that provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the operating system
# Bash (bash) â€” Default on Linux and macOS
# How is a Shell Different from a Kernel?
#      Shell	           Kernel
# User interface	   Core of the OS
# Interprets commands  Manages system resources (CPU, memory)
# Runs on top of OS	   Directly interacts with hardware
